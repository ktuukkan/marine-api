## About

Java Marine API is an [NMEA 0183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) parser
library for decoding and encoding the data provided by various electronic marine
devices such as GPS, echo sounder and weather instruments.

### Features

- Generic and extentable API
- Detects NMEA 0183 sentences from most input streams
    - E.g. from file, serial port, TCP/IP or UDP socket
    - The provided data readers can be overridden with custom implementation
- Converts the ASCII data stream to event/listener model with interfaces and parsers for [selected sentences](#nmea-0183)
- Additional parsers may be added by extending the provided base classes
    - This can be done at runtime and does not require compiling the library
- Sentence encoding with common validation and unified formatting
- Several sentences can be aggregated to single event by using [providers](./src/main/java/net/sf/marineapi/provider)
    - For example, to record current position and depth of water
- Decoding of selected [AIS messages](#ais)
- The NMEA 0183 layer of [Raymarine SeaTalk<sup>1</sup>](http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=5535)
- Utilities and enumerations for handling the extracted data

### Licensing

Java Marine API is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the [GNU Lesser General Public License](./LICENSE) published
by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

Java Marine API is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

### Disclaimer

Java Marine API is not official NMEA 0183 software. Further, it is not related
to [National Marine Electronics Association](http://www.nmea.org/).

The interpretation of NMEA 0183 and related protocols is based entirely on
varying set of publicly available [documents](#references) in the Internet.
Thus, it is not guaranteed that the library follows and implements these
standards correctly.

Electronic devices and software do not replace safe navigation practices and
should never be your only reference.

### Requirements

* Java 2 SE JRE/JDK v1.8.0 or newer
* For serial port communication:

    * [Neuron Robotics Java Serial Library](https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial)
    * [PureJavaComm](http://www.sparetimelabs.com/purejavacomm)
    * [RXTX library](http://rxtx.qbang.org)
    * [Java Communications API](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-141752.html)

### Usage

Write a listener:

    class GGAListener extends AbstractSentenceListener<GGASentence> {
        public void sentenceRead(GGASentence gga) {
            Position pos = gga.getPosition();
            // .. your code
        }
    }

Set up the reader:

    File file = new File("/var/log/nmea.log");
    SentenceReader reader = new SentenceReader(new FileInputStream(file));
    reader.addSentenceListener(new GGAListener());
    reader.start();

Manual parsing:

    String nmea = "$GPGSA,A,3,03,05,07,08,10,15,18,19,21,28,,,1.4,0.9,1.1*3A";
    SentenceFactory sf = SentenceFactory.getInstance();
    GSASentence gsa = (GSASentence) sf.createParser(nmea);

overridden and additional parsers may be added at runtime, _without compiling_
the library. See wiki for

## Distribution

Releases and snapshots are published every now and then, but there is no clear
plan or schedule for this as most of the development happens per user requests
or contribution.

### Pre-built JARs

Release JARs may be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/ktuukkan/marine-api/releases)
and [Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/marineapi/files/Releases/).
The ZIP package should contain all to get you going.

The project was first published in Sourceforge, hence the `net.sf.marineapi`
package naming.


### Maven

Both releases and snapshots are deployed to [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22net.sf.marineapi%22)
and may be imported by adding the following dependency in your `pom.xml`.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.sf.marineapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>marineapi</artifactId>
      <version>0.10.0</version>
      <type>bundle</type>
    </dependency>

#### Snapshots

The snapshots should be mostly stable, but they are still *Work In Progress* and
should be considered as a preview of the next release.

See [changelog](changelog.txt) for the current `SNAPSHOT` version. Notice that
you may need to tweak your [Maven settings](https://gist.github.com/ktuukkan/8cf2de1e915185118c60)
to enable snapshot dependencies.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.sf.marineapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>marineapi</artifactId>
      <version>0.11.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>bundle</type>
    </dependency>

Snapshots may also be downloaded manually from the
[repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/sf/marineapi/marineapi/).
