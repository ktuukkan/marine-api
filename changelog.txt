Version 0.7.0 (2014-02-21)

 - AbstractSentenceListener; base class for creating listeners with automatic
   sentence type resolving and casting.
 - Support for ROT sentences; vessel's rate of turn.
 - SentenceId; fixed a bug in parseStr(), sentence id length was assumed to be
   exactly three chars. This prevented parsing proprietary sentences that may
   have ids of different lenghts.
 - PositionEvent; fixed speed returned in knots instead of km/h.
 - TalkerId; added new id 'CP' (Channel Pilot).
 - SentenceReader; refactored and removed duplicate code.
 - Javadoc improvements


Version 0.6.0 (2013-10-15)

 - SentenceReader; refactored to better support diffrent data sources, including
   some performance tweaks (should take less CPU now). When dispatching events,
   all exceptions thrown by SentenceListeners are now logged using the default
   java.util.logging.Logger on level WARNING.
 - SentenceValidator; performance tweaks in regular expressions. Sentence length
   is no longer strictly checked, sentence IDs may contain now 3-10 chars.
 - SentenceParser; due to changes in SentenceValidator, toSentence() does not
   automatically check sentence length anymore. Added toSentence(int) method
   for validating the length. Added reset() and setFieldCount(int) methods for
   resetting and adjusting the number of data fields.
 - TPVProvider and related classes renamed to PositionProvider.
 - GSASentence; getSatellitesIds() renamed to getSatelliteIds().
 - Sentence; removed unused constant ADDRESS_FIELD.
 - Date, Time; fractions of second are now handled. Moved common date/time
   parsing and formatting in Date and Time classes. Fixed a bug in Time.toDate()
   causing incorrect hour of day. Added time zones and ISO 8601 formatting.
 - GLL, GGA, RMC and ZDA parsers; fractions of second are now parsed and
   formatted in timestamp fields. When setting/formatting values, three decimals
   is used regardless of given precision (padded with zeros as needed).
 - Position; refactored and removed explicit hemisphere indicators. Hemispheres
   are now handled more automatically and indicated by positive and negative
   values of latitude and longitude. Affected classes are PositionParser,
   GGAParser, GLLParser, RMAParser, RMCParser, WPLParser and Waypoint.
 - UDP/DatagramSocket support in SentenceReader.
 - SatelliteInfoProvider; reports all GPS satellite information in single event.
 - PositionParser; parsePosition(Position) and setPositionValues(Position)
   methods.
 - ZDASentence; setTimeAndLocalZone(Time t) for setting time and offset.
 - Support for XDR sentences; transducer measurements.

 Contributions:
 - Thanks to Ludovic Drouineau for UDP implementation of SentenceReader.
 - Thanks to Robert Huitema (www.42.co.nz) and Vladimir Loginov for performance
   tweaks. Robert also provided base work for XDR parser.


Version 0.5.1 (2015-05-11)

 - Converted to Maven project, otherwise identical to v0.5.0. Not published as
   zip package. Thanks to Amanda Fenech / marssa.org for migrating the project
   in Maven layout and setting up the initial release in Central Repository.


Version 0.5 (2012-05-08)

 - GpsMode enum; renamed to FaaMode
 - SentenceValidator; separated sentence format validation and checksum checking
   in different methods by adding isSentence(String) method.
 - SentenceFactory; DBT and HDT parsers were registered incorrectly, fixed.
 - DPTSentence; added maximum depth setter/getter.
 - Extracted AbstractProvider base class from TPVProvider, may be used to
   implement custom providers. Added also base classes for provider events and
   listeners.
 - SentenceParser/SentenceValidator; added support for alternative begin
   character '!' to enable parsing AIS sentences.
 - Added new ids AI, AB and BS in TalkerId enum to support parsing AIS messages.
 - Fixed a precision problem in ZDA parser.
 - Improvements and fixes in Javadocs.
 - Support for MWV sentences; wind speed and angle.
 - Support for MTA sentences; air temperature.
 - Support for MTW sentences; water temperature.
 - Support for HDT sentences; current true heading.
 - Support for HDM sentences; current magnetic heading.
 - Support for HDG sentences; current magnetic heading with variation/deviation.
 - Support for VHW sentences; water speed and heading.
 - HeadingSentence interface for sentences providing current heading.
 - HeadingProvider that reports current heading.
 - SentenceFactory; added method for creating parsers without input data.
 - SentenceParser; setDegreesValue(double) method for bearing, course etc,
   validates the value to be within 0..360 degrees.

 Contributions:
 - Thanks to Warren Zahra / marssa.org for contributing in VHW and MTW parsers.
 - Thanks to Josué Alcalde González for adding support for '!' begin char.


Version 0.4 (2011-07-12)

 - SentenceFactory; DPT parser was not automatically registered, fixed.
 - Parsing methods in SentenceId now validates the given String before parsing
   the id.
 - Double values are now rounded to certain decimal precision by setters. Also,
   course and bearing values are padded with leading zeros.
 - SentenceReader; reader now invokes SentenceLister.readingPaused() when data
   flow is paused, but reader is still running. The readingStopped() is now
   called only when reader has permanently stopped. Pause timeout can be set
   using the SentenceReader.setPauseTimeout() method.
 - SentenceValidator; fixed regular expressions to match all printable ASCII
   characters. Added also '!' as acceptable begin character.
 - TalkerId; Added more complete list of talker ids.
 - SentenceEvent; creation time stamp is now returned as plain long value.
 - Date; constructor was setting month off by one, fixed.
 - Added method for unregistering parsers in SentenceFactory.
 - Added TPVProvider that reports time, position, altitude, velocity and course
   from GPS in a single event. Report is constructed by capturing the required
   data from several sentences. This is also the initial implementation and
   preview of high level APIs that focus on actual data instead of sentences.
 - SentenceParser; added methods for setting double and integer values with
   leading zeros. Double values can also be rounded to certain precision.
 - SentenceListener; added readingPaused() notification.
 - Sentence; added convenience methods isValid() and isProprietary().


Version 0.3 (2011-05-08)

 - Refactored and moved sentence id parsing to TalkerId and SentenceId enums.
 - GSA parser; refactored the satellite data parsing. The values were parsed
   once and cached, which resulted in inconsistency if setters had been used.
   Now, all values are parsed for each getter call.
 - SentenceParser no longer uses SentenceId enum to identify different sentence
   types. Plain Strings are used instead, e.g. "GGA" or "GLL", which enables
   extending the SentenceParser and thus creating custom parsers for unsupported
   sentence types.
 - Various small improvements and bug fixes.
 - SentenceReader notifies when data reading and event dispatching has started
   and stopped.
 - Support for DPT and DBT sentences, i.e. depth of water.
 - Support for parsing proprietary sentences (TalkerId.P)


Version 0.2 (2010-12-08)

 - SentenceReader does not start automatically anymore. Use start() and stop()
   methods to control reader.
 - Removed NMEA class; moved checksum calculation to Checksum class and sentence
   validation to SentenceValidator class.
 - PositionParser is no longer public (unlikely to have any use).
 - GpsFixQuality enum; added RTK, FRTK, ESTIMATED, MANUAL and SIMULATED.
 - DataStatus enum; renamed VALID/INVALID to ACTIVE/VOID to better reflect the
   actual char values 'A' and 'V'.
 - Sentence interface; added getFieldCount() method.
 - Position class; added toString() method.
 - RTESentence interface; added addWaypointId() method.
 - ZDASentence; added toDate() method.
 - Various small improvements and bug fixes
 - SentenceReader; SentenceListeners can be registered for specific sentence
   type. Added setter for changing the input stream.
 - Date class for handling date information

 - SentenceEvent/Listener for receiving NMEA updates
 - SentenceFactory for creating sentence parsers
 - Interfaces and parsers for following sentence types:
   BOD, GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV, RMB, RMC, RTE, VTG, WPL and ZDA
