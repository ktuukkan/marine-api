Java Marine API - RELEASE NOTES
Version @VERSION@ (b@BUILD_ID@)
<http://ktuukkan.github.io/marine-api/>

This is a pre-alpha release, major API changes may be introduced in future
versions. Released on @RELEASE_DATE@.

NEW FEATURES

 * AbstractSentenceListener; base class for creating listeners with automatic
   sentence type resolving and casting.

CHANGES

 * SentenceId; fixed a bug in parseStr(), sentence id length was assumed to be
   exactly three chars. This prevented parsing proprietary sentences that may
   have ids of different lenghts.
 
 * PositionEvent; fixed speed returned in knots instead of km/h.
 
 * Javadoc improvements
  
KNOWN ISSUES

 * Position.distanceTo() may produce inaccurate results.

 * All AIS sentences may not be supported as TalkerId has only AI, AB and BS.
