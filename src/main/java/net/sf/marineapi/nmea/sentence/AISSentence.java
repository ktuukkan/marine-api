/**
 * <p>
 * Base interface for all AIS sentences (Automatic Identification System).
 * Notice that &quot;AIS&quot; does not refer to NMEA sentence type, but another
 * system/standard that transmits it's messages using NMEA 0183.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AIS sentences are parsed in two phases and they all share the same NMEA
 * sentence layout, so there is no dedicated interfaces for each AIS sentence
 * type (VDM, VDO etc).
 * </p>
 * <p>Example:</br>
 * <code>!AIVDM,1,1,,B,177KQJ5000G?tO`K>RA1wUbN0TKH,0*5C</code></p>
